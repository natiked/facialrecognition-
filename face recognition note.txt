How does the face recognition work 

The face recognition use the HOG(Histogram of oriented gradients) method which was invented in 2005

It passes different steps in order to get the outcome 

1st: It detects the face from the image by using the HOG method at the back end
     The HOG method is a complex way of detecting a face first it makes the images in black and while then it looks at each  pixel in the 
     image one at a time  then it looks at the darkness of the image in each pixel and uses arrows to show the direction that the image gets darker
     and replaces the pixels with gradient(arrows). And picks the strongest gradient from a 16*16 pixel to make it better.

2nd: It deals with the posing and projection of faces 
     The second step of the face recognition module is dealing with the posing of the face and for this step it uses an algorithm caleed face landmark 
     estimation made by Vahid Kazemi and Josphine Sullivan. It uses 68 specific points called landmarks. And uses the dlib library at the back end. And this algorithm
     solves the problem of posing.

3rd: Encoding files
     It uses 128 measurnments to differentiate between different images that would me more reliable 

4th: Finding the person's name from the encoding 
    It looks at all the faces we've measured in the past, see which person has the closest measurnments to our face's measurnments. That's our match.
